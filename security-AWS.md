## What Is AWS Responsible For?
AWS is responsible for security of the cloud. This means AWS is required to protect and secure the 
infrastructure that runs all the services offered in the AWS Cloud. AWS is responsible for:

	Protecting and securing AWS Regions, 
	Availability Zones, 
	and data centers, d
	own to the physical security of the buildings

Managing the hardware, software, and networking components that run AWS services, such as the physical server, 
host operating systems, virtualization layers, and AWS networking components






`Note`

Container services refer to AWS abstracting application containers behind the scenes, not Docker container services. This enables AWS to move the responsibility of managing that platform away from customers.


## What Is the Customer Responsible For?
You’re responsible for security in the cloud. When using any AWS service, you’re responsible for properly configuring the service and your applications, as well as ensuring your data is secure.

The level of responsibility you have depends on the AWS service. Some services require you to perform all the necessary security configuration and management tasks, while other more abstracted services require you to only manage the data and control access to your resources. Using the three categories of AWS services, you can determine your level of responsibility for each AWS service you use. 



Due to the varying level of effort, it’s important to consider which AWS service you use and review the level of responsibility required to secure the service. It’s also important to review how the shared security model aligns with the security standards in your IT environment, as well as any applicable laws and regulations.
 
It’s important to note that you maintain complete control of your data and are responsible for managing the security related to your content. Here are some examples of your responsibilities in context.

Choosing a Region for AWS resources in accordance with data sovereignty regulations

Implementing data protection mechanisms, such as encryption and managing backups

Using access control to limit who has access to your data and AWS resources
